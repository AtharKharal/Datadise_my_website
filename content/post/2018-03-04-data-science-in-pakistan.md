Pakistan currently seems way behind as far as awareness let alone education of Data Science is concerned. Though a huge number of students is available in raw form with background training in Mathematics, Statistics and / or Computer Science.  

Some programs are being run presently in IT University, Lahore and IBA Karachi. But their standing is too rudimentary at the moment. One hopes the HEC and Universities would endeavour to tap this huge potential for raising an ex-pat workforce which is highly paid on one hand and on the other hand their development and training does not ask for expensive equipment as needed in other discipline like Physics, Biology etc.
