Antenna design is a time consuming and tedious task which needs to be speeded up. This 
work discusses time efficient determination of antenna radiation pattern and return loss 
based on Artificial Neural Network. Return loss and radiation pattern data has been 
parameterized using Bezier parameterization and then optimized using genetic algorithm 
(GA) for better results. Finally, Feed-Forward Back-Propagation (FFBP) neural network has 
been trained based on normalized optimized Bezier parameters. Results show that neural 
network based antenna models are well suited for applications that require time efficient 
determination of antenna properties.
