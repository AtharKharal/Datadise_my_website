This is one my major result of the work we have been doing since many years. Applying Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms based machine-learning and optimization on a variety of problems in the field of Aerospace Engineering we transformed the slow computation into lightening-fast tools based upon neural computation based machine learning.
