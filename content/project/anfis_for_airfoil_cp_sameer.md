A neuro-fuzzy inference system was developed to estimate the wind pressure round an aerodynamic object. The system required extremely small time for its computation whereas the same computation using Navier-Stokes equations required 4 to 5 computing hours. Our developed system produced 64 fuzzy rules as well. Study of these rules for further analytical extension in CFD is now underway. The work was graded as the 2nd best by the faculty.
