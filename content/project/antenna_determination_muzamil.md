Determining the geometry of an electromagnetic object which satisfies pre-stated electromagnetic scatter-patterns is the inverse problem in Antenna Theory. This project developed a neural net for this problem for various antennas. Resulting geometries have been cross checked using a total Navier Stokes solver and very accurate results have been found.
