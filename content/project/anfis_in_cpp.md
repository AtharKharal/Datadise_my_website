A multipurpose Fuzzy Logic based inference engine has been developed. Written in C++ it can be embedded in other applications, for example in a PIC microcontroller to fabricate a neuro-fuzzy chip. This engine has already been used by another project to find the pressure distribution around airfoils.   (NUST/CAE/AE/Kashif_985514)
