A custom neural network was developed using MATLAB, for a precision critical but ill posed problem. The neural net replaced a faulty computer assembly at Mirage Rebuilt Factory of Pakistan Air Force at Kamra. Additional work was done by interfacing the neural output with industrial machines. The project was adjudged by the faculty of College of Aeronautical Engineering (NUST) to be the best and was awarded Best Project Gold Medal. Results of this project were also presented as research paper at a conference.  (NUST/CAE/AE/WAQAS_PMA733027)
