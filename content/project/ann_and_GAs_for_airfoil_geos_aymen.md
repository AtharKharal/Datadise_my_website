Determining the geometry of an aerodynamic object which satisfies pre-stated distribution of the forces of lift and drag at different angles of attack is the inverse problem in CFD. This project developed a neural net for this problem for NACA airfoil series. Resulting geometries have been cross checked using a total Navier Stokes solver and very accurate results have been found. The project was graded as 2nd best by the faculty of CAE.
