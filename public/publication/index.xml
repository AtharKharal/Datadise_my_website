      <description>This is one my major result of the work we have been doing since many years. Applying Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms based machine-learning and optimization on a variety of problems in the field of Aerospace Engineering we transformed the slow computation into lightening-fast tools based upon neural computation based machine learning.</description>

      <description>Determining the airfoil geometry from a given C p-distribution is an inverse problem of paramount importance specially in the context of variable geometry aerodynamic platforms. This work describes the implementation of artificial neural nets for the airfoil geometry determination. Instead of using full coordinates of the airfoil, Bezier-PARSEC 3434 parameters have been used to describe an airfoil. Some of these parameters have been determined using a Genetic Algorithm. In the second stage C p-distribution in terms of cl, cd and cm for 10 angles of attack has been input into three different neural nets for learning and then estimating the corresponding BP3434 parameters.</description>
